  <p class= "eb-garamond"> Although New York City is a cosmopolitan city, the importance of the green spaces and parks do not go unnoticed.</p>
<p class= "eb-garamond"> Many neighborhoods use their neighborhood parks or green spaces to cater for themselves and the youth in their life/community. The usage of parks is crucial in any community, which is why when there is such obvious negligence to the local parks, local members seem to become enraged. </p>

  <p class= "eb-garamond">Neglected Parks have been described as overgrown nature, trash discarded recklessly </p>

  <p class= "eb-garamond">For the sake of making the information digestible, the focus will be on The Bronx. </p>

<p class= "eb-garamond"> According to NYC Open data, there are roughly 386 parks or green spaces within The Bronx. Each park falls under a specific jurisdiction. Essentially there are different organizations that are responsible for the upkeep and representation of the parks, who may work alongside the NYC Parks department. For the most part, the Department of Parks and Recreation are the sole members who have jurisdiction over a green space.

  </div>
<p class= "eb-garamond"> The Parks Department maintains these parks and future projects within a park through city council funding. There is an entire capital process to undergo that ensures a project that is desperately needed within a community is met. </p>

<p class= "eb-garamond"> As anything political, not every need is met. This is clear within the parks aspect as seen in previous instances.</p>

<p class= "eb-garamond">Bronx back in 2019 describing how neglected this park was and the fact that many community people rarely considered it a park. They also explain that the Parks department along with Bronx community board 4, finally proposed to allocate funds to rebuild the park and make it functional–which they did accomplish. </p>

  </div>
<p class= "eb-garamond"> Despite this very needed and happy ending for Corporal Irwin Fischer Park, this is often not the reality of many other parks, especially in the Bronx. </p>

<p class= "eb-garamond"> Oftentimes the conditions of parks in the Bronx are found hazardous for even an adult to step foot in, with drug paraphernalia (used and unused) thrown about, trash covering the area and if it is a playground usually outdated playground equipment.</p> 

<p class= "eb-garamond"> The New York Times covered St. Marys Park in the Bronx that emulates this exact description. Due to the increasing and incessant complaints via community members, the Parks Department has made it a priority to clean up and pour into the maintenance of this park. Many people are also frustrated at the fact that the conditions of this park reinforce stereotypes of what The Bronx “is”. According to the times article there have been major improvements thus far, yet there is still work to be done. </p>

<p class= "eb-garamond"> There are numerous other parks in the Bronx that have essentially become dumping grounds for trash and a hub for drug use. Many community members are either completely fed up with the situation or feel there is nothing to be done at this point, although they feel there should be something done. </p>

<p class= "eb-garamond">There are even instances in which people may not even know a park or green space exists due to the extreme negligence that is experienced. Such as University Woods Park in University/Morris Heights. This Park is almost 4 acres of land adjacent from Bronx Community College, yet people do not realize it is a park. </p>

<p class= "eb-garamond"> It is mainly used as the path to go from one area to another because of the steps that cut through it. However, the trees and leaves are completely overgrown and the same conditions of a dumping ground are represented here as well. This park however, has not gotten enough advocacy thus far. Bronx Community board 5 is working on this, however as seen with previous parks the capital process for funding a project is a long and tedious one.
